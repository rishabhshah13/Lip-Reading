were sitting down with Barak Obama,

00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,600
- Uh, really?
- Yeah.

177
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:55,970
Ok, yeah.

178
00:07:55,980 --> 00:08:00,440
I mean it's always good
to have more eyes on it.

179
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:06,890
It's... sent it.

180
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:10,360
Oh, you're making fun of me.

181
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:12,730
- Dude, no.
- No, you are.

182
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:14,530
- Aw, Ricky, man.
- Ricky. Ricky, come back.

183
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:16,240
It's actually Richard, so that's...

184
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:21,320
- Pied wiper.
- Wide diaper.

185
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:24,990
Gates, Ellison,

186
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,500
Jobs, Dell.

187
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:33,250
All dropped out of college.

188
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:36,670
Silicon Valley is the cradle of innovation

189
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,760
because of drop outs.

190
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:43,180
College... has become a cruel

191
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:47,360
expensive joke on the poor

192
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,100
and the middle class

193
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:53,990
that benefits only the perpetrators of it.

194
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,110
- The bloated administrators.
- You are a dangerous man,

195
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,830
spewing ignorance!

196
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:02,250
I don't think so.

197
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:05,000
I'm just saying people
should trust themselves

198
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:09,290
more than a system that happily
churns out unemployed debtors

199
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,620
and provides dubious value.

200
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:15,850
The true value of a college
education is intangible.

201
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:19,850
The true value of snake-oil
is intangible as well.

202
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,890
[Laughter]

203
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:23,000
Fascist.

204
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:28,140
Anything?

205
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:30,140
The usual riffs on twitter and instagram.

206
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:33,570
Nothing I'd fund.

207
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:35,870
- Hi, excuse me, Mr. Gregory?
- [Sighs]

208
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,980
I have an idea I'd love to
pitch you, if you have time.

209
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:41,150
Oh.

210
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:44,410
Well, that is before I just
give up and go back to college.

211
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:46,750
Don't! Do not do that.

212
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:48,420
Go work at Burger King.

213
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:50,800
Go into the woods and
forage for nuts and berries.

214
00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:55,930
Do not go back to college!

215
00:09:55,930 --> 00:09:58,430
I think I have been played.

216
00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:00,390
Fine. Go ahead and pitch.

217
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,760
You have until I fasten
the seat-belt in my car.

218
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:04,590
Thank you so much.

219
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:07,110
Pied Piper is a proprietary
site that lets you find out

220
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:10,150
if your music is infringing
on any existing copyrights.

221
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,110
So, imagine you were a song writer, ok?

222
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:15,290
I don't think I could write a song.

223
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:18,320
Yeah, no, just imagine if you were.

224
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:22,360
I don't even think I could say,
"Pied Piper is a proprietary site."

225
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:24,580
Well, I just did but it wasn't easy.

226
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:27,080
Crunching all those songs

227
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:30,420
to find matches sounds like it would
take incredible processing power.

228
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:32,370
- I mean...
- Yes.

229
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:34,620
Yes, it does.

230
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:38,510
No, no. Its... I made an algorithm.

231
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:43,220
Look, why don't you send me a link to
your project and we'll take a look.

232
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:45,220
Ok, yeah, great.

233
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:47,690
I put the prototype up on github.

234
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,970
Pied Piper. I'll look it up.

235
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:52,440
It's like the fable with the kids

236
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:56,620
and then the rats and the music.

237
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:07,490
That is a narrow car.

238
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,960
Fucking billionaires.

239
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:14,170
Hey, wanna check out twig-boy's website?

240
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:19,250
Yes, I do.

241
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:21,670
You have to download your own media player?

242
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,890
Ahh.

243
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:29,350
Look at me, I traveled back to 2009.

244
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,930
Wait a sec.

245
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:33,580
What is this file size?

246
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:36,900
1.2 megabytes? No way.

247
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:41,940
Wow, that doesn't sound at all downgraded.

248
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:43,660
The file size is like, half.

249
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:48,040
And look how fast this search is.

250
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:52,340
Holy shit, how did it
find a match that fast?

251
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:56,540
It's like it's searching compressed files?

252
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:58,010
No way.

253
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:01,260
[Rock music playing]

254
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:02,630
Look at that weissman score.

255
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:05,380
2.89.

256
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:07,630
Hey, where have you two been?

257
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,900
We're playing the multi-channel
router team in five minutes.

258
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:12,110
Ok, how the hell did he do this?

259
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:15,400
And the compression is totally lossless.

260
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:25,650
And he's somehow figured out a way to
do a search on a compressed data space.

261
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:27,320
- Holy shit.
- Yeah.

262
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:29,290
And I don't think he even
realizes what he has here.

263
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:31,250
He's using it for some
silly songwriter app.

264
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:34,090
All these guys are like that,
they're all about consumer facing.

265
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:35,960
Right, but you take something like this,

266
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:38,760
make it business facing
and use it for enterprise?

267
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:43,430
The applications could be endless.

268
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:45,970
Hey, I thought you were a satanist?

269
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:48,310
I'm a LaVeyan Satanist

270
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,100
with some theistic tendencies.

271
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:51,560
Oh, some theistic tendencies.

272
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:52,980
Well then, what's with the cross?

273
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:55,260
It's an upside down cross.

274
00:12:55,270 --> 00:13:00,020
Not from here it isn't.

275
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:02,910
Oh, I see, you know what you should do?

276
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:05,660
You should get another tattoo
that says, "this side up" on it.

277
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:07,290
How does this translate into Farsi?

278
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:08,910
That's not the language I speak.

279
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:12,950
[Erlich] Frontier Airlines just
happened to like mine, Aviato.

280
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:15,200
And that's how I got to where I am.

281
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:17,790
So... what do you got?

282
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,870
Ok, here it is.

283
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,960
Bit Soup.

284
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:25,960
It's like alphabet soup but

285
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:32,440
it's ones and zeros instead of the letters.

286
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:35,560
'Cause it's binary. You know,
binary is just ones and zeroes.

287
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:36,940
Yeah, I know what binary is.

288
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:39,440
Jesus Christ! I memorized
the hexadecimal times tables

289
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:41,730
when I was 14 writing machine code!

290
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:44,030
Ok. Ask me what nine times f is.

291
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,490
It's fleventyfive.

292
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:47,620
I do not need you telling
me what binary is,

293
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:51,590
just like I don't need you thinking
about soup or taking pictures of it.

294
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,370
I need you thinking about
apps, software, websites.

295
00:13:54,380 --> 00:14:00,330
This is Silicon Valley, all right, not...

296
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:03,720
Paris, Texas.

297
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:05,620
That's where Campbell's soup is.

- [Cell phone ringing]
- [Chatter on computer]

299
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:11,340
[Sighs] It's the Hooli number again.

300
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:12,840
It's probably those brogrammers.

301
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:15,060
Can't wait to tell me
how stupid my website is.

302
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:16,400
Assholes.

303
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:20,980
Hello, Richard Hendricks.
I'm a total fucking retard.

304
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:25,350
Uh. Hi, this is Jared
Dunn calling from Hooli.

305
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,690
I'm calling a behalf of Gavin Belson.

306
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:30,690
I didn't... hi.

307
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:34,160
Gavin is very excited about
your Pied Piper application

308
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:36,000
and we were wondering if you could come in

309
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:37,750
for a sit-down with us.

310
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,710
- <i> Are you available now.</i>
- Ok.

311
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:41,550
- Sure. Yes.
- <i> Ok, we'll be here.</i>

312
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:43,550
[Stutters] Good-bye.

313
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:46,890
Uh, I have a meeting with Gavin Belson.

314
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:48,430
He likes Pied Piper.

315
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,300
- Holy shit.
- I own 10 percent of Pied Piper.

316
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:51,710
You said it was a shitty idea.

317
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,770
It was a shitty idea.

318
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:55,380
I'm not sure what it is now.

319
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:57,600
- What time's the meeting?
- Right now.

320
00:14:57,610 --> 00:15:01,810
I'm gonna need a better shirt.

321
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:04,140
Holy shit.

322
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:07,460
What the fuck am I waiting for? See ya.

324
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:21,490
Well, it's like Gavin always says,
"it takes change to make change."

325
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:24,760
Yeah, I think I've seen
that written around.

326
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:27,720
- Hey.
- Hi.

327
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:29,840
Gavin is running 30 minutes late

328
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:34,430
but you should know he is very
excited to see you, Richard.

329
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:35,840
He's with his spiritual advisor.

330
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:37,560
He shouldn't be that much longer.

331
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:40,930
I'm a VP here and I only get to
see him about ten minutes a month.

332
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:45,180
But that 10 minutes is just incredible.

333
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:47,990
I heard Richard Hendricks was here.

334
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,110
Have you ever met Gavin before?

335
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,770
- No.
- No?

336
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:54,450
Oh, I told him, it's amazing.

337
00:15:54,450 --> 00:16:00,030
That hardly begins to describe it.

338
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:02,130
It's weird.

339
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:05,040
They always travel in groups of five.

340
00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:08,590
These programmers, there's
always a tall skinny white guy,

341
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,760
short skinny Asian guy,

342
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:12,210
fat guy with a ponytail,

343
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:14,180
some guy with crazy facial hair

344
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:17,480
and then an East Indian guy.

345
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:22,050
It's like they trade guys until
they all have the right group.

346
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:28,390
You clearly have a great
understanding of humanity.

347
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,860
And Gavin said I'm not humiliating you,

348
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:32,900
I'm elevating you.

349
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:34,820
Ah, Gavin.

351
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:44,000
This is Richard.

352
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,340
It's Peter Gregory.

353
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:51,070
Ah, no.

354
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,130
Come on, Big Head.

355
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:53,750
Yeah, I'm coming. Slow...

356
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,850
Why are you going that fast?

357
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:58,020
We've got a meeting with Gavin
Belson. Pick up the pace.

358
00:16:58,020 --> 00:17:07,230
- We honestly don't.
- Come on.

359
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:11,030
I'm actually outside of Gavin Belson's
office right now, Mr. Gregory.

360
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:14,070
Uh, here he comes, so
can I call you back in...

361
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:20,000
So, Richard Hendricks is here!

362
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:22,360
There you are, Richard.

363
00:17:22,370 --> 00:17:24,780
So sorry these gentleman
have kept you waiting.

364
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:26,250
- That's fine.
- So here's the thing.

365
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:28,470
I love what you did.

366
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,710
- Really?
- Fill him in, Jared.

367
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,550
Now, as you know, Hooli is seen as possibly

368
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:35,760
the most progressive company in the world.

369
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:38,300
Part of that is Gavin's
commitment to social justice,

370
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:40,880
but part of it is his personal commitment

371
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:43,060
to the people that work at Hooli.

372
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:46,390
In that spirit Gavin is prepared to
give you a very substantial raise...

373
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,860
And a promotion to go with it.

374
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:49,890
I own 10 percent.

375
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,890
He created it while living in my Incubator.

376
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:55,400
Erlich Bachman. This is Big Head.

377
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:59,410
I don't know what any of that means, but I'll
give you six hundred thousand dollars for it.

378
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:02,400
We have the reach and the resources
to take what you have done

379
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:05,370
and push it to the global level.

380
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:08,490
That is a generous offer.

381
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:12,080
Shit, sorry. Hello.

382
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:14,580
Really? No shit, that's...

383
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:18,260
Uh, yeah, yeah. No here.
It's Peter Gregory.

384
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:20,810
Not sure how he got my number?

385
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:22,140
Uh, this is Richard.

386
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:25,600
I'll give you three million
dollars for it right now!

387
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:30,150
Ah, Gavin Belson just offered me
three million dollars for Pied Piper.

388
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:33,600
I'm prepared to give you three
hundred thousand dollars.

389
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:38,270
Peter Gregory just offered me 300, um...

390
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,030
Did you say thousand dollars?

391
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,740
For ten percent of your company.

392
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:44,360
Ok, four million.

393
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:46,680
200 thousand.

394
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:48,830
- For five percent.
- Huh?

395
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,960
You just went down.

396
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:54,630
No, you're still valued
at four million dollars.

397
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:59,010
But you own ninety-five percent of
a potential billion-dollar company.

398
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:02,650
<i>And not just that, I will
help you build this company.</i>

399
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:05,430
I will introduce you to
the people you need to know

400
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,770
and provide the counsel that you need.

401
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:11,190
I will take a small piece, but
the company will belong to you.

402
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:15,140
<i>Not Gavin Belson.</i>

403
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:17,990
<i>You have until</i> <i>tomorrow to decide.</i>

404
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:21,120
Ah, ok.

405
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:24,040
- Um, you know.
- Pull your head out of your ass, Richard.

406
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:28,910
I'm offering you four
million dollars right now.

407
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:31,660
I'm...

408
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:36,580
That is a lot of money.

409
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:38,330
You know, I actually have to...

410
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:40,680
I've got to go to the bathroom.

411
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,140
I've got to pee.

412
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:44,590
It's desperate. I'm bursting.

413
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,340
I'll be right back, but right now...

414
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:47,680
Ok, 10 million.

415
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:50,360
No. Maybe.

416
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,520
I didn't mean to snap at you.

417
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,270
I'll talk... in a bit.

418
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,310
Won't be long.

419
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,360
Little more about me.

420
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:04,910
I am the founder of Aviato.

421
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:07,530
And I own a very small
percentage of Grindr.

422
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:10,450
It's a men to men dating site

423
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:12,280
where you can find other
men within 10 miles of you.

424
00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:15,290
Interested in having sexual
intercourse in a public restroom.

425
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:18,490
In the homosexual community
there's sometimes anonymous...

426
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,840
I know what Grindr is.

427
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:21,230
I have gay friends.

428
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:29,050
[Retching]

429
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:33,860
So you will survive.

430
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:36,560
It's just a garden variety panic attack.

431
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:38,190
Welcome to Silicon Valley.

432
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:40,060
We see people like you all the time.

433
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:41,780
- Really?
- Yes.

434
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:44,200
It's just I have to make
this decision by tomorrow.

435
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:45,740
Yeah. You know, a while back,

436
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:47,990
we had a guy in here in almost
the exact same situation,

437
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,870
"take the money or keep the company."

438
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,040
What happened?

439
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:54,830
Well, a couple months later

440
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:58,210
he was brought into the ER with
a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

441
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:00,080
I guess he really regretted
not taking that money.

442
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:03,300
He shot himself because
he turned down the money?

443
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:04,970
Yeah.

444
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:07,270
Or no, he took the money.

445
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:09,260
Or no.

446
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:10,640
No, he did not. I don't... You know what?

447
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:12,270
I don't remember. But whatever it was,

448
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:14,060
he regretted it so much that
he ended up shooting himself.

449
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:16,400
- And now he's blind.
- He's blind?

450
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:18,320
Yeah, just fyi, if you're
ever gonna shoot yourself,

451
00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:19,940
don't hold the gun up to your temple, ok?

452
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:21,070
Because that just basically just took out

453
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,610
both of his optic nerves and then,

454
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:24,190
you know, half of his face.

455
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,910
And then his wife left
him, because, you know.

456
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,950
- Yikes.
- Right.

457
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,530
He may have been a genius programmer

458
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:33,290
but not so much in human anatomy.

459
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:35,450
Or decision making, for that matter.

460
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:36,790
Now he's got to live with all that

461
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:39,800
and whatever terrible decision
he made about the money.

462
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:44,930
Uh. And what do I do if I feel
another panic attack coming on.

463
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:48,430
Would you be interested in a device

464
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:51,020
that links up to your
smartphone and it keeps track

465
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:53,650
of your vitals and it tells
you, even before it's happening,

466
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:56,440
whether you're having a panic
attack or an actual heart attack?

467
00:21:56,450 --> 00:21:58,640
Yeah, that sounds great.

468
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:01,860
You would, right? Ok, that's great news.

469
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:04,060
Because it's still in
prototype phase right now,

470
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:05,660
but my start-up partners and
I are looking for investors.

471
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:08,150
Like today. So will you
please let me know...

472
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,320
I'm going to give you my number.

473
00:22:09,330 --> 00:22:11,330
If you do end up taking
that 10 million dollars

474
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:14,740
because we could really make
the world a better place.

475
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:17,720
- [Retching]
- Whoa! Oh, jeez!

476
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:26,140
Richard.

477
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:29,050
Hi, Monica. I work with Peter Gregory.

478
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:31,420
- We met outside the TED...
- Yeah, I remember you.

479
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:35,350
What... how'd you know I was here?

480
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,010
Peter Gregory is invested in a company

481
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:39,430
that uses GPS in phones to track people.

482
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,200
That's creepy.

483
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:43,490
You don't know the half of it.

484
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:46,770
And neither does congress.

485
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:50,330
- Are you ok?
- Look, I don't want to waste your time.

486
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:52,860
I think I gotta take the
money from Gavin Belson.

487
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:55,080
At least this way when
I blow my eyeballs out

488
00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:58,250
I'll have some money left for my family.

489
00:22:58,260 --> 00:22:59,540
Jesus.

490
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:03,960
Sorry. That is a terrible doctor in there.

491
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:07,390
Richard, buried in that clunky UI of yours

492
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:11,550
is a compression algorithm that
blew our engineering team away.

493
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:13,890
And what do you think Hooli
is going to do with it?

494
00:23:13,890 --> 00:23:16,020
I don't know. That's their business.

495
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:17,470
This is your baby.

496
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,890
Do you even realize the
impact that a compression

497
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:21,940
this good could have on the world?

498
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:24,310
Getting any file on your
mobile phone in an instant.

499
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,530
Navigation data for self-driving cars,

500
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:28,900
mobile medical imagery,

501
00:23:28,910 --> 00:23:32,480
all transmitting with no quality loss.

502
00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:35,650
This is game-changing.

503
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:38,240
Don't you want to be in the
driver's seat when that happens?

504
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:41,920
You really want to just turn it
all over to Hooli and walk away?

505
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,910
[Sighs]

506
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:47,170
Well, you are not making
this easier for me.

507
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:48,590
I'm not trying to.

508
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,140
I mean you're actually making it worse.

509
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:52,670
My hands are tingling. I have
this metal taste in my mouth.

510
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:55,340
Actually, I can't go back in
there, so I'm going to go home.

511
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:58,060
- Let me give you a ride home.
- Good to see you again.

512
00:23:58,070 --> 00:23:59,820
Uh, ok. Thanks.

513
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:03,900
Dude, where have you been?

514
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:05,440
Why won't you answer your phone?

515
00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:07,280
Man, this has grown way beyond angellist.

516
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:10,780
Andreesen, elevation and like a bunch of
other seed funds are piling onto this thing.

517
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:12,270
I mean, they've been calling Erlich.

518
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:14,120
He's out of control.

519
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:16,700
Yeah.

520
00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:19,620
What if we took Peter Gregory's 200k

521
00:24:19,630 --> 00:24:21,120
and built our own company?

522
00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:22,460
[Gilfoyle] I'm sorry. You said we.

523
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:24,670
Who's that in reference to exactly?

524
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:27,870
You, me, Dinesh, Big Head, us.

525
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,510
I mean, right now Pied
Piper just does audio,

526
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:32,430
but I'm thinking of ways to
compress images, video...

527
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:34,310
I mean, maybe Peter Gregory's right.

528
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:36,010
Maybe this could be huge.

529
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:38,140
Look, guys, for thousands of years

530
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:40,640
guys like us have gotten
the shit kicked out of us.

531
00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:43,860
But now, for the first time,
we are living in an era

532
00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:46,940
where we can be in
charge and build empires.

533
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:50,730
We could be the vikings of our day.

534
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:52,870
- Vikings?
- How are you feeling?

535
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,950
You look super fucked up to be honest.

536
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:59,320
[Erlich] Who ate my fucking quinoa again?

537
00:24:59,330 --> 00:25:02,990
So you're really about to go tell Erlich that
he's not going to get his one million dollars?

538
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,160
Yeah, I don't want to be
there when you do that.

539
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:06,670
I would like to be there when you do that.

540
00:25:06,670 --> 00:25:11,750
No, just stay here, please.

541
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:15,750
Hey.

542
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:18,340
Um, so, I've been thinking about

543
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:23,510
this whole Peter Gregory,
Gavin Belson thing.

544
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:28,180
And, um, I think I'm going
to go with Peter Gregory.

545
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:31,190
- Uh, which I know means...
- Richard.

546
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:36,460
I know that you look at me, and see
a guy who has it all figured out.

547
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:39,530
And for the most part, you're right, I do.

548
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:40,950
When I sold Aviato,

549
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:44,750
it gave me a house, money, fancy clothes,

550
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,890
the universal respect of all the ladies.

551
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:50,710
But there's always been a hole in my heart.

552
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,220
Not a literal hole like you would find

553
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:55,380
in some babies with congenital diseases,

554
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:57,380
but a metaphorical hole.

555
00:25:57,390 --> 00:25:59,880
I guess that hole is the "what if".

556
00:25:59,890 --> 00:26:02,680
What if I didn't sell?

557
00:26:02,690 --> 00:26:04,520
I'll never know.

558
00:26:04,530 --> 00:26:07,220
And so I guess what I'm
saying to you now is,

559
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:09,470
you're like me, Richard.

560
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,560
You want to build something

561
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:14,280
and see it through.

562
00:26:14,290 --> 00:26:16,650
So, just to be clear.

563
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:18,820
You're all right with
me saying no to a deal

564
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:20,900
that will net you a
million dollars outright?

565
00:26:20,910 --> 00:26:22,750
No, Richard. I'm not all right with it.

566
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:25,070
I'm excited about it.

567
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:29,630
Let's see how high this
rocket can fly, partner.

568
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,160
[Chuckles]

569
00:26:31,170 --> 00:26:33,580
Ok. Great.

570
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:36,050
That's great.

571
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:38,670
Not partners, exactly.

572
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:41,660
But everything else is great.

573
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:46,300
Call it what you want.

574
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:48,930
[All] Always blue,
always blue, always blue,

575
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:51,680
always blue, always blue, always blue,

576
00:26:51,690 --> 00:26:53,570
always blue, always... [yelling]

577
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:55,350
Oh! That was a yellow.

578
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,660
What was that, 17?

579
00:26:56,670 --> 00:26:58,490
- Pretty good.
- Hey, guys...

580
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:01,080
Guys, can I just kind of
say something real quick?

581
00:27:01,090 --> 00:27:03,450
I know it's stupid but, um...

582
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:05,830
I just want to say, uh,

583
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:09,750
I'd like for this company
to be different than Hooli

584
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,630
and Goolybib and all the rest, you know?

585
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:14,840
Like, let's like not turn
this into a corporate cult

586
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:17,130
with bike meetings and voluntary retreats

587
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:18,840
that are actually mandatory.

588
00:27:18,850 --> 00:27:21,850
And claiming to make the world
a better place all the time.

589
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:25,130
Let's, uh, let's just think different.

590
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:27,550
Don't think different. That's Apple.

591
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:29,690
Uh, umm...

592
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:31,470
Let's just... Let's just do it.

593
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,280
- That's Nike, man.
- I know that's nike.

594
00:27:33,290 --> 00:27:35,140
- Yeah.
- Uh...

595
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:36,320
Fuck it. I don't know.

596
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,110
Let's just make it...
Let's just make it happen.

597
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:40,570
Yeah, agreed.

598
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:42,830
To his beneficence.

599
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:44,320
Peter Gregory?

600
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:46,990
- The Dark Lord.
- Of course, The Dark Lord.

601
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,160
Big Head. [Laughs]

602
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:53,000
God, he's worse high.

603
00:27:53,010 --> 00:27:56,080
[Laughter]

604
00:27:56,090 --> 00:28:00,390
[All] Always blue, always blue,
always blue, always blue...

605
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,550
